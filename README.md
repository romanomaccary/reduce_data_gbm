This repository contains the pipeline to analyse GRBs from Fermi/GBM and compute the minimum variability timescale, the evolution
of the four properties listed in Maccary et al. 2026, and the position of a given burst in the E_pi-E_iso plane. This pipeline can
be used to quickly obtain indices of merger origin from the prompt emission time profile to incite for multi-wavelength campaign.
